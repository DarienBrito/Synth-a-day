# Synth-a-day
A repository containing SuperCollider code with a new Synth everyday

Typically, I will try to code something daily in under an hour. For this reason, some code will be more interesting than other... in other words, probably some code will suck! The point is that in this endevour I'm trying to trigger my creativity and programming skills, so for the moment that doesn't bother me that much...
